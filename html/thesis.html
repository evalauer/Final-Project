SeaWorld has been making a splash in the media, and I wanted to dive deeper into this topic. Last year I worked for the Wild Dolphin Foundation on Oahu in Hawaii. This foundation held private charters to educate guests about marine life, as well as swim alongside dolphins and throughout coral reefs. This foundation opposes the practice of animal and marine life captivity, and believes that the only way that humans should interact with animals should be in the wild. After working for the Wild Dolphin Foundation, I have grown interested in both the legality as well as the ethics behind animal captivity. My interest was furthered after watching the documentary Black Fish, which discusses the recent controversy that these parks have sparked. The question that I am pursuing is how likely it is that SeaWorld will be shut down within the next few years. I personally believe that, from an ethical as well as a legal standpoint, SeaWorld should be shut down, but my research suggests that although SeaWorld might undergo some changes, it will most likely not close.
</p>

SeaWorld opened initially in 1964 by four graduates of UCLA. It is a chain of parks containing marine life, such as orcas, sea lions, and dolphins, as well as roller coaster rides. Initially, Busch Entertainment Corporation owned SeaWorld. In 2009, Busch was sold to Blackstone Group and was then renamed SeaWorld Entertainment. In 2013, SeaWorld had its initial public offering. Blackstone sold 19.9 million shares at $27 and then kept a 63% stake in the company. SeaWorld now operates in Orlando, Florida, San Antonio, Texas, and San Diego, California. In 2013, Gabriela Cowperthwaite released the documentary Blackfish. This film tells the story of the orca named Tilikum, who has killed and injured several people over the years. Blackfish highlights the dangers and problems that exist within the sea-park industry, and particularly within SeaWorld. After this film grew famous, SeaWorld’s popularity plummeted. Attendance at parks tanked, company stock fell, and many companies cut ties with SeaWorld. In 2014, attendance had fallen by 5.2%, profits were down 28%, and SeaWorld’s stock had dropped 50%. These companies included Hyundai, savings.com, Taco Bell, Outdoorplay.com, STA travel, and many more. Southwest Airlines ended its partnership with SeaWorld after twenty-five years, and stock analysts indicate that this loss was definitely detrimental to its share price. This is an ongoing issue, with new bills being proposed and new developments occurring all of the time.

I personally do not believe that it is ethical for animals to be in captivity for purposes of human entertainment, such as a zoo, a circus? aquarium? or marine park. I know, however, that this is not illegal, but I wanted to learn the rules and regulations surrounding these practices. The Animal Welfare Act became law in the United States in 1966. This law is currently the only federal law pertaining to the conditions and treatment of animals that are used for transport, research, exhibition, and by dealers. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service is the USDA department responsible for enforcing the Animal Welfare Act.  So what does the act say?
</p>

<p>
Recently there have been many lawsuits regarding the Sea World’s treatment of whales. The USDA has cited SeaWorld for violating the Animal Welfare Act. These lawsuits have hurt attendance at parks as well as overall revenue. Sea World mistreats its animals, and there is much evidence to prove this point. Orcas, or “killer whales” have particularly been in the spotlight of scrutiny. To begin, the tanks are too shallow for the orcas. In the wild, they would be deeply submerged in the ocean and would therefore be shielded from the sun. At SeaWorld, their tanks are extremely shallow. The deepest tank is 40 feet deep, which is not deep enough to shield them from the sun. Therefore, they get extremely sunburned. Sea World covers up these sunburns with a black zinc oxide so that visitors to the park cannot notice the burns.

<p>
Despite recent concerns, SeaWorld is currently listed as accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). This association works on the advancement of aquariums and zoos in terms of education, science, conservation, and recreation. The AZA works on animal care initiatives, conservation and education programs, and research as well as political lobbying to help advance the aforementioned goals. The intention of this organization is to accredit aquariums and zoos that surpass the standards of animal care set by law. AZA renews accreditations every five years. One positive aspect of SeaWorld’s operation is its conservation program that it runs in conjunction with the Department of the Interior and National Marine Fisheries Service. This rescue program was developed in order to be complicit with the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 as well as the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Through these programs, SeaWorld has saved over 23,000 sick or abandoned animals including dolphins, sea turtles, birds, manatees and pilot whales. While these programs tend to be positively viewed by the public, overall critics still believe that overall SeaWorld is having a negative impact on our world’s marine life, and many organizations, such as PETA, believe that SeaWorld’s accreditation should consequently not be renewed.
</p>

<p>
Among the biggest advocate groups fighting against SeaWorld is People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA. PETA’s main areas of focus are laboratories, entertainment, the clothing trade, and on factory farms because the organization feels that these fields are where the most animals suffer for the longest amount of time. PETA has sent official comments to AZA to advocate that the organization should not renew SeaWorld’s accreditation. PETA has also sent letters to SeaWorld’s new CEO Joel Manby, after the previous CEO Jim Atchinson stepped down in January 2015. PETA is wary of Manby because its research shows that there were incidents of animal deaths and cruelty in the parks where he was previously CEO. Other organizations that protest the captivity of marine life include the World Animal Protection and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society. They are all working together to aid in the process of lobbying and protesting, in hopes of making drastic changes to SeaWorld.

<p>
I only believe in animal captivity if the animals have been severely harmed in the wild and humans take them in to help them recuperate until they are strong enough to return to the wild. This is certainly not the case for the majority of SeaWorld’s operations, despite the rehabilitation programs that it runs. Initially, SeaWorld captured its animals from the wild and stripped them away from their families. In fact, when SeaWorld captured one if its original whales named Shamu, it actually murdered her mother with a harpoon during the process. These animals in captivity were not breeding amongst themselves successfully. This could be attributed to a lot of factors, such as deformities and injuries from living in the tanks, or a lack of proper and natural space. Now, SeaWorld forces its animals to breed in an unnatural way. It practices a captive breeding program, which means that the trainers essentially collect semen from males and impregnate females. SeaWorld was the first place where an orca was born into captivity, and was also the first place to use artificial insemination in the process of breeding orcas. This process also forces these animals to be reproducing at unnatural ages. Captive breeding could be justified at a zoo for an endangered species, to try and help proliferate it, but this process does not make sense for orcas because they are not endangered.
</p>

<p>
SeaWorld has also been under scrutiny from a public relations standpoint for the way in which it has managed this crisis. From the start, experts say that SeaWorld mismanaged its reaction to the film Blackfish. It did not allow any company executives to be in the documentary, and it also responded critically to the film before it had actually aired, which drew even more attention to the issue. Furthermore, SeaWorld began to delete facebook posts with opinions and reactions to the film as a part of their crisis communications response, which only furthered the outrage of consumers. SeaWorld attempted to emphasize the positive rescue work that it does for animals, but should have instead let consumers voice their opinions and be heard, instead of overlooking the issue. Next, many bands and artists that were supposed to come to SeaWorld began to cancel. SeaWorld scrutinized these performers, instead of engaging in public conversations and discussions regarding the thoughts and concerns of the bands and of the public that was protesting. SeaWorld has become an example of how not to handle a public relations crisis. The lesson learned is that it is important to cover both traditional as well as social media, and to engage consumers and protestors in discussion in order to allow their voices and opinions to be heard.
</p>

<p>
Although SeaWorld’s crisis management has been sub-par, the park has been making multiple short-term changes as well as plans for long-term adjustments. Recently, SeaWorld ended its public dolphin-feeding program, after there were incidents of children being bitten by dolphins. They have also released plans to build bigger tanks for the orcas. While in some eyes these plans are a step in the right direction, in my opinion, as well as the opinion of PETA, this is not good. Building new tanks means that SeaWorld has no plans to phase out orca captivity. If SeaWorld must display orcas, PETA advocates for coastal sanctuaries. These are pens that are in the actual ocean. The staff at the Wild Dolphin Foundation explained to me that coastal sanctuaries are, in their opinion, the only way in which any animals, even rescued animals, should ever be encaged, even though they still find them to be prison for animals. Coastal sanctuaries are pens within the actual ocean. This means that although these animals are still technically in captivity, they are within their natural habitat, and thus are much better off than being in a tank. While many protestors argue that SeaWorld should transition into the usage of costal sanctuaries, the parks currently have no plans to do so and are still planning on building larger tanks.

<p>
The safety and well being of the animals is not the only current concern pertaining to SeaWorld. Much of the national attention has been directed at the safety of the trainers as well. Just this past week, SeaWorld San Diego was issued four different citations from the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA). Last year SeaWorld appealed a citation for exposing trainers to the dangerous conditions of working closely with killer whales, but the Court of Appeals upheld the citation. This incident occurred in response to the death of trainer Dawn Brancheau who was killed by the orca named Tilikum. These deaths, as highlighted in Blackfish, have outraged the public and have sparked much activism and demand for change. In 2014, Richard Bloom, a California assembly member, proposed the Orca Welfare and Safety Act. This act would ban the display of orcas for the use of entertainment, and would also ban the practice of captive breeding. The Committee of Water, Parks and Wildlife discussed this bill, and it was subsequently tabled for further discussion and research.
I argue that the ideal scenario would be for SeaWorld to phase out captive breeding instead of instantly shutting down. Many protestors advocate for SeaWorld to be shut down as soon as possible, but these people, albeit passionate, do not understand the implications of this result. If SeaWorld were to be shut down or bankrupt instantaneously, the company would need to sell or release all of its animals. History demonstrates that this process is not a positive or plausible one. In the 1990s, the movie Free Willy was produced. This movie displayed the relationship between a child and a captive orca. The producers of this movie used a real captive whale named Keiko that lived in a park in Mexico. This whale was extremely underweight, was living in the wrong climate, and was very sick. A similar phenomenon to Blackfish, Free Willy sparked activists across the world to begin working towards saving this whale. The Free Willy/ Keiko Foundation was formed. Unfortunately, due Keiko’s illnesses, he was unable to be purchased by another park. The foundation brought him back to his native waters of Iceland and attempted to reintegrate him into ocean life. This is a very difficult process, because when whales have lived most of their life in captivity, they do not know how to function in the ocean. The foundation trained him to eat live food, and swim in the ocean, and eventually released him into the wild. He was found shortly after allowing children to ride on his back, and soon after that, was found dead.
</p>

<p>
The instance of Keiko serves as an example to the fact that captive marine life cannot successfully be set free back into the ocean. In the ocean, these mammals are born into pods, and they stick with these pods for the entirety of their development. During this time they learn all that they need to know about hunting and surviving, under the guidance of the pod. When an animal has been taken from its pod at a young age, it is difficult to relocate this pod, and nearly impossible to reintegrate. Even more of a challenge is presented when animals have been bred and born into captivity, because then they have no knowledge or experience with the ocean whatsoever. Therefore, if SeaWorld were to be shut down or go bankrupt, these animals would most likely die in the wild. The only other option would be to sell them to another park. Many of these parks are international, and have even lower standards of care than SeaWorld, meaning that their fate would be even worse.
In conclusion, while many organizations and I believe that SeaWorld should phase out captive breeding and eventually be shut down for good, my research concludes that realistically this will not happen. Too many people benefit financially in the industry, and too many people in power do not share the same views as activists and animal rights advocates. I think that this topic is very pertinent to the discipline of Science, Technology, and Society. It pertains to science because the livelihood of marine life is involved, and the field of science is needed to analyze the effects and repercussions that occur when removing animals from their nature habitat. This also relates to technology, because technologies are involved in capturing these animals, and then sustaining them, albeit it minimally, outside of their natural ecosystem. Most significantly, I believe that this topic pertains to society. Captivity of animals is an important debate amongst humans, and while it is currently legal, it is an issue that has been brought into the spotlight recently. With the help of activists and passionate people, we could see change brought to this issue in the future.
